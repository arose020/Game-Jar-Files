THANK YOU FOR DOWNLOADING!


ABOUT
______________________________________________________________________________

I am new to scripting and I made a little program that I call Captain Andrew

This took quite some time to get to where it is so give me a break

I made my own remix of Minecrafts random engine, check it out
Everytime you run it, it is a different pattern


INSTRUCTIONS
______________________________________________________________________________

Double click to run

GOAL: Dont run into trees, stay on the land...

(It wont do anything if you run into a tree or jump in the river)


TROUBLESHOOTING
______________________________________________________________________________

If it doesnt run, you need JDK, you can download it here

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

You want the Windows x64 download unless your computer is x86... you can check
that by going to Control Panel>System and Security>System and under system
type it will say 64 bit opperating system or 86 bit opperating system. But
for most of you, it would be 64 bit.
